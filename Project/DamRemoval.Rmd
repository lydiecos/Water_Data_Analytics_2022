## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data download}
KennParams <- whatNWISdata(siteNumbers = "01049500")
# Parameters available:
# 00060 Flow
# 00010 Water Temp C
# 00020 Air Temp C
# 00028 Agency analyzing sample code
# 00061 Discharge cfs
# 00095 Specific water conductance
# 00300 Dissolved oxygen
# 30209 Discharge

Kenndata <- whatNWISdata(siteNumbers = "01049500")
KennFlow <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = "01049500",
                    parameterCd = "00060",
                     startDate = "",
                     endDate = "")




KennWQ <- readWQPqw(siteNumbers = "USGS-01049500", # Cobbosseecontee Stream at Gardiner, Maine
                     parameterCd = c("00915", # calcium, filtered mg/L
                                     "00925", # magnesium, filtered mg/L
                                     "00930", # sodium,filtered mg/L
                                     "90095",  # Specific conductance, uS/cm
                                     "31625",  # Fecal coliform, CFU/100 mL
                                     "31673"),  # Fecal streptocci, CFU/100 mL
                     startDate = "1976-01-01",
                     endDate = "")


# Penobscot
# 01036390
# Veazie Dam removal
# btw Veazie and Eddington, Maine

PenParams <- whatNWISdata(siteNumbers = "01036390")
# This looks like a better candidate - 253 rows)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
