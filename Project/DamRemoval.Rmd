## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data download}
# Neuse River at Kinston
# Downstream from several dams around Goldsboro that were removed in 1998, 1999, 2006, and 2017.
NeuseParams <- whatNWISdata(siteNumbers = "02089500")

# Download discharge data
NeuseFlow <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = "02089500",
                    parameterCd = "00060",
                     startDate = "",
                     endDate = "")
names(NeuseFlow)[4:5] <- c("Discharge", "Approval.Code")
ggplot(NeuseFlow, aes(x = Date, y  = Discharge)) +
  geom_line()

# Download water quality data
NeuseWQ  <- readWQPqw(siteNumbers = "USGS-02089500",
                      parameterCd = c("00915", # calcium, filtered mg/L
                                      "00925", # magnesium, filtered mg/L
                                      "00930", # sodium,filtered mg/L
                                      "90095", # Specific conductance, uS/cm
                                      "31625", # Fecal coliform, CFU/100 mL
                                      "31673"), # Fecal streptocci, CFU/100 mL
                      startDate = "",
                      endDate = )

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r process, echo=FALSE}
NeuseWQ_processed <- NeuseWQ %>%
  select(MonitoringLocationIdentifier, ActivityStartDate, HydrologicCondition, 
         CharacteristicName, ResultMeasureValue) %>%
  mutate(Variable = case_when(CharacteristicName == "Fecal Coliform" ~ "FecalColiform_cfu.100mL", 
                              CharacteristicName == "Fecal Streptococcus Group Bacteria" ~ "FecalStrep_cfu.100mL",
                              CharacteristicName == "Specific conductance" ~ "SpC_uS.cm",
                              CharacteristicName == "Calcium" ~ "Calcium_mg.L",
                              CharacteristicName == "Magnesium" ~ "Magnesium_mg.L",
                              CharacteristicName == "Sodium" ~ "Sodium_mg.L")) %>%
  select(-CharacteristicName) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Variable", values_from = "ResultMeasureValue")
summary(NeuseWQ_processed)

ggplot(NeuseWQ_processed, aes(x = ActivityStartDate, y = Calcium_mg.L)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
